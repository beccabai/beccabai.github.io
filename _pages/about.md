I'm a senior undergraduate student at [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](https://www.bit.edu.cn/), majoring in Statistics and minoring in Artificial Intelligence. I'm currently working as a research assistant at [Peking University DAIR lab](https://github.com/PKU-DAIR), supervised by [Prof. Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/). I expect to graduate in 2023 and I am aiming for a PhD position for 2023 Fall.

My research interests mainly focus on Machine Learning, especially Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML). Previously I worked on Transfer Learning for Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) and Bayesian Optimization. Presently I am focusing on some online scenarios.

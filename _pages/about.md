I'm a Ph.D. student at CSE, HKUST, supervised by [Prof. Binhang Yuan](https://binhangyuan.github.io/site/). I am also fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Wentao Zhang](https://zwt233.github.io/) of [PKU-DCML Group](https://github.com/Open-DataFlow). Previously I worked as a research assistant at [Peking University DAIR lab](https://github.com/PKU-DAIR), supervised by [Prof. Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/).

My research interests mainly focus on Efficient Training for Large Language Models and Multimodal Large Language Models.

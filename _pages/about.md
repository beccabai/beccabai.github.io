I'm a Ph.D. student at CSE, HKUST, supervised by [Prof. Binhang Yuan](https://binhangyuan.github.io/site/). Before that, I got my B.S. degree in Statistics and B.Eng. degree in Artificial Intelligence from Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT). Previously I worked as a research assistant at [Peking University DAIR lab](https://github.com/PKU-DAIR), supervised by [Prof. Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/).

My research interests mainly focus on Data management for Large Language Models. Previously, I focused on Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML), especially Hyperparameter Optimization problem.
